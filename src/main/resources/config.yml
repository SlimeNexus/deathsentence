# This plugin allows you to configure death messages for very specific circumstances.
# This freedom also means that it's very hard to cover all the possible ways in which
# a player can die in the configuration. This is why the plugin relies heavily on
# fallback messages. Here is an example of which places in the configuration the plugin
# checks first when a player is killed by a skeleton hitting the player with a bow
# which has a custom name (damage type: arrow).
#
# 1) special_item_death -> skeleton -> arrow
# 2) special_item_death -> skeleton -> generic
# 3) special_item_death -> default -> arrow
# 4) special_item_death -> default -> generic
# 5) entity_death -> skeleton -> arrow
# 6) entity_death -> skeleton -> generic
# 7) entity_death -> default -> arrow
# 8) entity_death -> default -> generic
# 9) natural_death -> arrow
# 10) natural_death -> generic
#
# If the skeleton was holding a weapon with no custom name, the lookup would start at
# step 5. If the player had died from a dispenser firing the arrow, the lookup would
# start at step 9.
#

# Fallback message when no other messages are available.
fallback_message: "%player% died."
